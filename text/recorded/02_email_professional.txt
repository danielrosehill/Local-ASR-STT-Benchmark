New email to Sarah Chen at TechCorp dot com. Subject: Follow-up on Q4 Integration Project.

Hi Sarah, hope you're doing well. I wanted to touch base regarding the API integration work we discussed last week. I've reviewed the technical specifications you sent over and I think we're in good shape to move forward.

A few quick points. First, the authentication flow looks solid but we should probably add rate limiting on our end to avoid hitting your API quotas. I'm thinking maybe 100 requests per minute should be sufficient for our use case. Let me know if that sounds reasonable.

Second, regarding the webhook callbacks - can you confirm which IP addresses we need to whitelist? Our DevOps team needs that information to configure the firewall rules before we can start testing in the staging environment.

Also, I noticed the documentation mentions support for both JSON and XML response formats. We'll definitely be using JSON, but just curious - is XML still widely used by your other clients or is that mostly legacy support at this point?

Timeline-wise, we're aiming to have the initial integration completed by end of November. That should give us a few weeks for testing before the holiday freeze. Does that align with your team's availability?

Let me know if you need anything else from our side. Happy to jump on a call this week if it's easier to discuss these details synchronously.

Thanks, Daniel.
